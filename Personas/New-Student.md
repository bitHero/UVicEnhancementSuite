Daniel is a smart, caring, but cautious man from  Houston, Texas. He caries forth his southern hospitality to everyone he meets, making him an easy man to get along with. After graduating from high school he stayed in his hometown to look after his family and sick grandmother. Working an evening job as a carpenter, he helped out with his family of 3 sisters and 2 brothers, 3 of which under the age of 12, by driving, running errands, and cooking food - after all, he was the eldest and assumed responsibility when his father passed away.

Four years after graduating, his grandma passed and with his siblings getting older, he decided to take a step forth in his life and get a degree in Earth and Ocean Sciences. Given the times he spent at the beach and lay in awe as the waves crash, or when a storm hits and the wind whips, he was fascinated in the science behind it all. UVic provided him with the program he wants and the lush greenery and coastal environment he so desired, and so his first week begins today.

**Habits**:

* Desktop (PC), Mobile (Android)
* Microsoft Office, Twitter
* Sketching
