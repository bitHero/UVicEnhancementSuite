Amy is an artistic 23 year old girl from Fredricton, New Brunswick. After graduating from high school she spent a year travelling. She fell in love with the many stories of people she met. Inspired by this, Amy set out to capture her perspective and tell stories through film.  

Once home in Canada, Amy began filmmaking with a couple friends. They spent a few months producing short films, but soon learned they needed more knowledge if they wanted to continue; so she decided to move to Victoria, BC and attend the University of Victoria. In her third year of film studies she's digging deeper into relevant courses while beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. As effective as Amy has been producing films, she can be a bit forgetful at times when her creativity takes over.
