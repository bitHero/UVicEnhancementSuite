##Milestone 4 Questions (Point-Form)

What question(s) will you try to answer through your user study? 

* Is the new site more intuitive?
* Is the new site faster? (less clicks and time)
* Has the new site *created* any *new* problems?

___
Which users will you recruit to try out the prototype? (refer to your personas for guidance!)  How many?  How will you recruit them? How will you gather their consent?

* Ideally, we would like to re-test all of our initial particpiants
* As well as adding many *new* participants, to account for practice effects (Generally aiming to double our original participant pool)
* We will use "small chocolates" to incentivize and recruit participants 

---
Which tasks will you ask your user to perform?  Why those tasks?  (refer to your use cases!)

* We will use the same questions/tasks as before (Located in appendix XX)
* These questions/tasks reflect our use cases

---
Where will you perform the study?  Why this setting?

* Quiet room
    * To not introduce any other confounding variables (e.g. noise, movement, other distractions)

---
Which environmental factors will you try to control?   

* Mainly noise and external movement (Additional people)

---
When will you conduct your study?  (Note: in order to incorporate user feedback in your final prototypes and to describe this feedback in your report, the evaluation should be completed before March 27th but probably this should be done earlier). 

* March 21st - March 25th

---
What kinds of data will you collect (e.g., survey, interview, observations, logging data)?  How will you collect this data? How will you analyze this data? 

* Data will be mixed:
  * Survey question responses (Written)
  * Quantitative info about effieciency of completing tasks 
     * Time spent (Minutes/ Seconds)
     * Mouse movement (Clicks)

---
How/when/with whom will you pilot your study design? 

  * Answered above

---
What roles will your team members play in the evaluation?  (Note every team member should observe at least one (preferably more) users using their prototype.)

  * Each team member will be responsible for recruiting and testing 4 participants (2 of which they already tested previously)

##Milestone 4 Questions (Proper Format)

###Study plan

####1. IntroductionThrough user testing, we hope to determine if our website is more intuitive, and faster to use than the existing UVIC MyPage. Furthermore, we aim to identify if our site has introduced any new issues with usability. ####2. Methods#####2.1 ParticipantsTo answer these questions, ~20 current UVIC students will participate in the study. Ideally, 10 of the participants will be from the initial-study testing pool, to perform a within-group comparison. To reach a total pool of 20, 10 new participants will be recruited to perform a between-groups comparison. To encourage individuals to take part in the study, all students will be offered a small chocolate for their participation. Each participant will be informed of the risks and procedures involved with the study, and will be asked to sign a consent form.#####2.2 PlatformA static webpage with emulated data will be used for the study. The website can be reached via any modern web-browser with Internet access.#####2.3 ProcedureEach participant will be tested in a quiet room with minimal distraction. The users will perform the study on their own computer to ensure comfort and familiarity with the system. After answering a selection of questions pertaining to relevant information (age, year of study, etc.), participants will be asked to perform a variety of tasks that will require them to navigate our site and use many of its various features. The full set of questions and tasks are located in _Appendix A_.These questions were selected because they require the user to perform actions that resemble daily and yearly tasks that would typically be completed by a UVic student (checking timetable, grades, etc.).Following the tasks, users will be asked a second set of more open-ended questions that aim to summarize the experience, and identify any further problems not already addressed. #####2.4 Information Gathering Responses to the survey questions asked at the beginning and end of the study will be recorded manually by researchers.While users are performing the tasks outlined in the middle of the study, information about mouse clicks and time spent per-page will be gathered and analyzed by analytics tools built into the website, or tabulated by hand (If we cannot get them working in time).####3. TimelineThe study will take place over five days, starting on March 21st and running until March 25th. Gathered data will be analyzed following the study and compiled by March 27th####4. ResponsibilitiesEach group member will be responsible for conducting four user-tests each (two participants from the initial tests and two newly recruited students).
