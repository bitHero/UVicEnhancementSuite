##Milestone 4 Question

What question(s) will you try to answer through your user study? 

* Is the new site more intuitive?
* Is the new site faster? (less clicks and time)
* Has the new site *created* any *new* problems?

___
Which users will you recruit to try out the prototype? (refer to your personas for guidance!)  How many?  How will you recruit them? How will you gather their consent?

* Ideally, we would like to re-test all of our initial particpiants
* As well as adding many *new* participants, to account for practice effects (Generally aiming to double our original participant pool)
* We will use "small chocolates" to incentivize and recruit participants 

---
Which tasks will you ask your user to perform?  Why those tasks?  (refer to your use cases!)

* We will use the same questions/tasks as before (Located in appendix XX)
* These questions/tasks reflect our use cases

---
Where will you perform the study?  Why this setting?

* Quiet room
    * To not introduce any other confounding variables (e.g. noise, movement, other distractions)

---
Which environmental factors will you try to control?   

* Mainly noise and external movement (Additional people)

---
When will you conduct your study?  (Note: in order to incorporate user feedback in your final prototypes and to describe this feedback in your report, the evaluation should be completed before March 27th but probably this should be done earlier). 

* March 21st - March 25th

---
What kinds of data will you collect (e.g., survey, interview, observations, logging data)?  How will you collect this data? How will you analyze this data? 

* Data will be mixed:
  * Survey question responses (Written)
  * Quantitative info about effieciency of completing tasks 
     * Time spent (Minutes/ Seconds)
     * Mouse movement (Clicks)

---
How/when/with whom will you pilot your study design? 

  * Answered above

---
What roles will your team members play in the evaluation?  (Note every team member should observe at least one (preferably more) users using their prototype.)

  * Each team member will be responsible for recruiting and testing 4 participants (2 of which they already tested previously)
