##Milestone 4 Question

_What question(s) will you try to answer through your user study?_



_Which users will you recruit to try out the prototype? (refer to your personas for guidance!)  How many?  How will you recruit them? How will you gather their consent?_

We'll try to recruit the same users we had in our initial testing and new users to account for practice effects. We're aiming for double our users from the first test, but we will try to get as many as possible. We'll use sugar-induced incentives to gain consent.


_Which tasks will you ask your user to perform?  Why those tasks?  (refer to your use cases!)_



_Where will you perform the study?  Why this setting?_



_Which environmental factors will you try to control?_



_When will you conduct your study?  (Note: in order to incorporate user feedback in your final prototypes and to describe this feedback in your report, the evaluation should be completed before March 27th but probably this should be done earlier)._



_What kinds of data will you collect (e.g., survey, interview, observations, logging data)?  How will you collect this data? How will you analyze this data?_



_How/when/with whom will you pilot your study design?_



_What roles will your team members play in the evaluation?  (Note every team member should observe at least one (preferably more) users using their prototype.)_
