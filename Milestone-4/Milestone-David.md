#UVic MySpace
##Milestone 4 Question

_What question(s) will you try to answer through your user study?_

We want to learn if our new prototype is easier to use in comparison to the existing UVic MyPage, and how students react to the new prototype format.

_Which users will you recruit to try out the prototype? (refer to your personas for guidance!)  How many?  How will you recruit them? How will you gather their consent?_

We'll try to recruit the same users we had in our initial testing and new users to account for practice effects. We're aiming for double our users from the first test, but we will try to get as many as possible. We'll use sugar-induced incentives to gain consent.


_Which tasks will you ask your user to perform?  Why those tasks?  (refer to your use cases!)_

We want our users to look at their time table for classes and find a student tax form, because students need to perform these tasks everyday (time table) or every year (tax form).

_Where will you perform the study?  Why this setting?_

We'll perform the study in a controlled environment to better observe users performing specific tasks.


_Which environmental factors will you try to control?_

We want them to be willing, and therefore in a calm state of mind. 

_When will you conduct your study?  (Note: in order to incorporate user feedback in your final prototypes and to describe this feedback in your report, the evaluation should be completed before March 27th but probably this should be done earlier)._



_What kinds of data will you collect (e.g., survey, interview, observations, logging data)?  How will you collect this data? How will you analyze this data?_

As well as using Observations we used in the first test, we'll use number of clicks, survey questions,...
We will still using obseravtion, but during the process we will collect more data this time.
We can use stat. table and make a comparsion between all the data.


_How/when/with whom will you pilot your study design?_



_What roles will your team members play in the evaluation?  (Note every team member should observe at least one (preferably more) users using their prototype.)_
Every team member will observe arund 4 people.
