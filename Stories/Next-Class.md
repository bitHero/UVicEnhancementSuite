It's Tuesday, Daniel has just started his first semester of classes at UVic. He needs to get to his first class, MATH 100. He finds the course on his timetable but doesn't know what DTB is. He finds out it's the David Turpin Building from the website but then someone says to "just go to SSM" and he gets confused. Not sure where his class is Daniel ends up in the David Strong Building and sits through a full hour and twenty minutes of ECON 103c.
