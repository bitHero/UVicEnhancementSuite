Lucius, like many other university students is starting to run out of money by his 3rd year of university. He decides to apply for a few scholarships. After spending a few hours on one of the applications, the form says to attatch a copy of his "Official Transcript" and "Summary of Tuition Fees". Lucius spends the rest of his night attempting to find these documents on the UVIC myPage website. Unfortunately, due to the confusing layout of the website he was unsuccessful, and unable to submit the application. Lucius did not recive the scholarship and was forced to drop out of school due to a lack of funds.
