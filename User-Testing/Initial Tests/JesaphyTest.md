## Tasks

When observing users perform tasks try to provide as little assistance as possible after the initial prompt. If a user gets stuck, talk to them about what problems they're having at that point and how they got where they are.

### Finding a Class

_What class do you have next? What's the professor's name?_

```

she went on google and typed uvic, she logged in and putted mouse on my online tooles and wait for the guide bar come out itself. Then she went on my timetable right under student services section, and clicked weekly timetable.(what class next found) Then she just clicked on that class, it took her to the detail of that class( professor name found).
Seems there is no difficulty for her to find a class.

From student services page (she was on my weekly timetable page), she moved the mouse on Finances bar and clicked the Account summary by term. Then she selected the term and found the balance.

She didn't know she can check her balance oninle. She was keep looking for it in Student Services, and then she clicked on My page. She mistakenly went on student tool and cann't find it. The she went back to My page. And then saw it under Other online tools section.

She never went on the OneCard Balance page online, she used to pay it at University Centre.

## Closing Questions

_Was there anything you found particularly difficult?_

```

OneCard and proof certificate.

Any other things hard to find beside what I asked in this survey?

  If trying to find anything use search bar in uvic page, it is really hard to get the answer you want. It is even faster to type it in goole.

And uvic email is suck. Sometime there are some pictures can only shown when you using a phone but not a laptop. And it can not tell if the email is sent or not. However, some prof force student to use the uvic email so we have to use it.



```

_Is there anything you think we missed?_

```


N/A
