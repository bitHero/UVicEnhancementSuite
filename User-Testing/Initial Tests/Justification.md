To help guide our design process our team will observe users in a controlled environment to collect qualitative data on how UVic students interact with the current UVic web services, in particular, MyPage and Student Services. After some brief background questions we will ask the students to perform a number of common tasks using the UVic web services.

We believe we can gather more useful information from observing in-person interactions and collecting qualitative data than performing either a quantitative or qualitative survey. Through one-on-one user testing we hope to gain an intuitive insight about how students use UVic web services. Also, in addition to corroborating and prioritizing our current list of pain points, we hope to discover further pain points.
