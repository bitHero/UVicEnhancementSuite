  UVic Enhancement Suite will observe users in a controlled environment to collect data
on how our target demographic interacts with the current UVic MyPage. We will ask our
testers some brief questions in regards to their background and experience with UVic’s
MyPage. Afterwards, we will ask our users to perform tasks related to finding specific
information on the site. Our facilitators will try and provide as little assistance as
possible to better emulate real-world scenarios.

  We believe we can gather more useful information from observing a few in-person testers 
than sending out impersonal questions to masses or analyzing statistical information. The 
data we want to collect involves how a student navigates UVic’s MyPage and note any problems
they may possess. It is not possible to numerate someone’s experience, therefore we must 
observe students to gauge their time. Furthermore, we do not necessarily know what data we 
need to collect. By observing users in person we can note things we did not expect.
